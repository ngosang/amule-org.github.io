title: eD2k & Kademlia Networks
---

aMule connects simultaneously to two peer-to-peer networks: the classic **[eD2k](ed2k-network.md)** (eDonkey2000) network and the serverless **[Kademlia (Kad)](kademlia.md)** network. Both networks share the same file identification system and can be used together to maximise download sources.

## History

The eD2k protocol was created by the **eDonkey2000** application, a proprietary P2P client that pioneered the network. eDonkey2000 was eventually displaced by open-source alternatives: first **mlDonkey** (Unix-focused), then **eMule** (Windows), which spawned many derivatives including **xMule** and ultimately **aMule** — the cross-platform, open-source implementation.

The eDonkey2000 website was shut down in 2006 following a RIAA lawsuit and the software is no longer maintained. aMule is a completely independent project and is not affiliated with the original eDonkey2000 in any way.

Kademlia was introduced into the \*Mule ecosystem in response to the architectural limitations of the server-based [eD2k network](ed2k-network.md). It is based on the Kademlia algorithm by Petar Maymounkov and David Mazières (New York University, 2002). aMule has supported [Kademlia](kademlia.md) since version **2.1.0**.

## How the Networks Differ

| Feature | eD2k | Kademlia |
|---|---|---|
| Architecture | Client-server | Fully decentralised (DHT) |
| Requires servers | Yes | No |
| Search scope | Server-local or global (all servers) | Distributed across all nodes |
| Connection type | Client connects to a central server | Client bootstraps from any known node |
| ID system | High ID / Low ID assigned by server | Open / Firewalled assigned by network |
| Privacy | Server sees your IP and searches | No central point of observation |
| Scalability | Limited by server capacity | Scales with number of participants |
| Introduced | Original eD2k protocol | aMule 2.1.0 (2006) |

Both networks use the same **MD4-based file hashes** and **9.28 MB chunk** system, so the same files can be downloaded from sources on either network simultaneously.
