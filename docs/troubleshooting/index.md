## Quick diagnostics

**I have a Low ID**
→ TCP port 4662 is not reachable from the internet. See [High ID and Low ID](../ed2k/high-id-low-id.md) and [Test Your Ports](./fake-files-and-servers.md#testing-your-ports).

**Downloads are very slow**
→ Work through the [Slow Download Speeds checklist](./slow-speeds.md#configuration-issues). The most common cause is an upload limit below 10 KBps.

**aMule slows down everything on my computer**
→ Your upload limit or connection count is too high. See [aMule Makes Everything Else Slow](./slow-speeds.md#amule-makes-everything-else-slow).

**I can't find my downloaded files**
→ Check `~/.aMule/Incoming` (or `~/Library/Application Support/aMule/Incoming` on macOS). Enable "Show hidden files" in your file manager.

**Kademlia says "firewalled" even though I have a High ID**
→ Your router is remapping UDP port 4672. See [High ID and Low ID — Kademlia: Open vs Firewalled](../ed2k/high-id-low-id.md#kademlia-open-vs-firewalled) and [Network FAQ → Kademlia firewalled](../faq/network.md#why-does-kademlia-still-say-it-is-firewalled).

**Search results contain many suspicious files**
→ You may be connected to a fake server. See [Fake Servers](./fake-files-and-servers.md#fake-servers).

**amuled won't let amulecmd connect**
→ External Connections are not enabled or the EC password is not set. See [Remote Access Troubleshooting → amulecmd](./remote-access.md#i-cannot-connect-to-amuled--it-doesnt-seem-to-be-listening-whats-wrong).
