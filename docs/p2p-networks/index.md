title: eD2k & Kademlia Networks
---

aMule connects simultaneously to two peer-to-peer networks: the classic **[eD2k](ed2k/index.md)** (eDonkey2000) network and the serverless **[Kademlia (Kad)](kademlia.md)** network. Both networks share the same [file identification system](concepts.md#hashing) and can be used together to maximise download sources.

## History

The eD2k protocol was created by the **[eDonkey2000](ed2k/clients.md#edonkey2000-20002005)** application, a proprietary P2P client that pioneered the network. eDonkey2000 was eventually displaced by open-source alternatives: first **[mlDonkey](ed2k/clients.md#mldonkey-2001present)** (Unix-focused), then **[eMule](ed2k/clients.md#emule-2002present)** (Windows), which spawned many derivatives including **[xMule](ed2k/clients.md#xmule-20032009)** and ultimately **[aMule](ed2k/clients.md#amule-2003present)** — the cross-platform, open-source implementation.

The eDonkey2000 website was shut down in 2006 following a RIAA lawsuit and the software is no longer maintained. aMule is a completely independent project and is not affiliated with the original eDonkey2000 in any way.

Kademlia was introduced into the \*Mule ecosystem in response to the architectural limitations of the server-based [eD2k network](ed2k/index.md). It is based on the Kademlia algorithm by Petar Maymounkov and David Mazières (New York University, 2002). aMule has supported [Kademlia](kademlia.md) since version **2.1.0**.

## How the Networks Differ

| Feature | eD2k | Kademlia |
|---|---|---|
| Architecture | Client-server | Fully decentralised (DHT) |
| Requires servers | Yes | No |
| Search scope | Server-local or global (all servers) | Distributed across all nodes |
| Connection type | Client connects to a central server | Client bootstraps from any known node |
| ID system | [High ID / Low ID](ed2k/high-id.md) assigned by server | [Open / Firewalled](kademlia.md#open-vs-firewalled-status) assigned by network |
| Privacy | Server sees your IP and searches | No central point of observation |
| Scalability | Limited by server capacity | Scales with number of participants |
| Introduced | Original eD2k protocol | aMule 2.1.0 (2006) |

Both networks use the same **[MD4-based file hashes](concepts.md#hashing)** and **[9.28 MB chunk](concepts.md#chunks-and-data-integrity)** system, so the same files can be downloaded from sources on either network simultaneously.
