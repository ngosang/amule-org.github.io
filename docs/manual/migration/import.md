The Import tool integrates eDonkey2000 part files into aMule so you can continue downloads that were in progress in eDonkey2000 without starting over. aMule detects the part files, converts them to its own format, and adds them to the download queue.

![Import window](/img/docs/usage/window_import1.jpg)

Open the Import tool by clicking the **Import** button in the [toolbar](../interfaces/gui/toolbar.md).

:::note
If you are migrating from **eMule**, the temporary file format is directly compatible — no import needed. See [Migrate from eMule](./migrate-from-emule.md) for the full migration guide.

If you are migrating from a client other than eDonkey2000 (e.g., mlDonkey or xMule), see [Import/Export Files](./import-export.md) for an alternative approach.

## Adding Files

Click **Add imports** to start selecting a directory to import from:

![Add imports button](/img/docs/usage/window_import2.jpg)

A directory browser appears. Navigate to the directory that contains your eDonkey2000 temporary files (or type the path directly in the text field), then click **OK**:

![Directory browser](/img/docs/usage/window_import3.jpg)

Directory browser controls:

![Directory browser controls](/img/docs/usage/window_import9.jpg)

| Control | Function |
|---|---|
| **Show hidden directories** checkbox | Check to display hidden directories; uncheck to hide them |
| House button | Jump directly to your home directory |
| New folder button | Create a new directory |

After selecting a directory, aMule asks whether you want to **delete the original files** once they are successfully imported:

![Delete originals prompt](/img/docs/usage/window_import4.jpg)

| Answer | Effect |
|---|---|
| **Yes** | Delete the original eDonkey2000 part files after successful import |
| **No** | Keep the original files intact |
| **Cancel** | Abort importing this directory |

If any eDonkey2000 part files are found, they are added to the import list:

![Files added to import list](/img/docs/usage/window_import5.jpg)

## Managing the Import List

Files in the import list are processed in sequence — as soon as one file finishes converting, the next begins. Only one file is imported at a time.

**Remove a file** from the list (cancels import if in progress) by selecting it and clicking **Remove selected**:

![Remove selected button](/img/docs/usage/window_import6.jpg)

**Retry a failed file** by selecting it and clicking **Retry selected**:

![Retry selected button](/img/docs/usage/window_import7.jpg)

:::note
The import list cannot be cleared manually — it is cleared automatically when aMule restarts.

## Monitoring Progress

The title bar of the progress area shows the path of the directory currently being imported:

![Current directory being imported](/img/docs/usage/window_import8.jpg)

When no import is active, the title reads **Waiting…**

A **progress bar** and **percentage** display show how far along the current file's import is:

![Import progress bar](/img/docs/usage/window_import10.jpg)

Detailed status messages appear above the progress bar:
