title: Import Tool
---

The Import tool integrates [eDonkey2000](../../p2p-networks/ed2k/index.md) part files into aMule so you can continue downloads that were in progress in eDonkey2000 without starting over. aMule detects the part files, converts them to its own format, and adds them to the [download queue](../interfaces/gui/downloads.md#download-queue).

![Import window](/img/docs/gui_import/import.png)

Open the Import tool by clicking the **Import** button in the [toolbar](../interfaces/gui/toolbar.md). The window that opens is titled **Import partfiles**. The tool is part of the all-in-one [`amule`](../interfaces/gui/amule.md) client only; [`amulegui`](../interfaces/gui/amulegui.md) has no **Import** button.

:::note
If you are migrating from **eMule**, the temporary file format is directly compatible — no import needed. See [Migrate from eMule](./migrate-from-emule.md) for the full migration guide.

If you are migrating from a client other than eDonkey2000 (e.g., mlDonkey or xMule), see [Migrate from Other Clients](./migrate-from-other-clients.md) for an alternative approach.

## Adding Files

Click **Add imports** to start selecting a directory to import from.

Your system's folder dialog appears. Navigate to the directory that contains your eDonkey2000 temporary files, then confirm it. The directory is searched including its subfolders, and every `.part.met` file found becomes one import job.

After selecting a directory, aMule asks whether you want to **delete the original files** once they are successfully imported:

| Answer | Effect |
|---|---|
| **Yes** | Delete the original eDonkey2000 part files after successful import |
| **No** | Keep the original files intact |
| **Cancel** | Abort importing this directory |

If any eDonkey2000 part files are found, they are added to the import list.

## Managing the Import List

Files in the import list are processed in sequence — as soon as one file finishes converting, the next begins. Only one file is imported at a time.

**Remove a file** from the list by selecting it and clicking **Remove selected**. The file currently being converted cannot be removed — the action is ignored for it.

**Retry a file** (any file that is not completed and not currently in progress — typically a failed one) by selecting it and clicking **Retry selected**. The file is put back into the queue.

:::note
The import list cannot be cleared manually — it is cleared automatically when aMule restarts.

## Monitoring Progress

The title bar of the progress area shows the path of the `.part.met` file currently being imported.

When no import is active, the title reads **Waiting…**

A **progress bar** and **percentage** display show how far along the current file's import is.

Detailed status messages appear above the progress bar.
