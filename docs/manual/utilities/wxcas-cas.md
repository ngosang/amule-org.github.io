title: wxcas / cas — Statistics Tools
---

wxCAS and CAS are external statistics tools that read aMule's online signature file (`~/.aMule/amulesig.dat`) and produce status output in various formats. They are shipped with aMule and serve users who want to embed aMule statistics in a website, forum signature, or terminal dashboard.

| Binary | Interface | Output |
|---|---|---|
| `wxcas` | Graphical (wxWidgets) | Graphical display of the same data |
| `cas` | Command-line | Console text, PNG image, HTML page |

## Prerequisites

Both tools read `~/.aMule/amulesig.dat`, which aMule only generates when **Online Signature** is enabled:

1. Open aMule → [**Preferences → Online Signature**](../interfaces/gui/preferences.md#online-signature).
2. Check **Enable Online Signature**.
3. Restart aMule (or wait for the next update cycle).

The same options can be set directly in [`amule.conf`](../configuration/config-files/amule-conf.md#online-signature) via the `OnlineSignature`, `OnlineSignatureUpdate` and `OSDirectory` keys.

`amulesig.dat` is updated periodically while aMule runs. The file must exist for `wxcas` or `cas` to produce any output. If you change the signature directory (the **Save online signature file in** preference, or the `OSDirectory` key), point the wxcas **amulesig.dat directory** setting and `cas -c DIR` at the same location.

For the full format specification of `amulesig.dat`, see the [amulesig.dat reference](../configuration/config-files/index.md#amulesigdat) in the Configuration Files reference.

## WxCAS — Graphical Statistics

`wxcas` provides a graphical window displaying the same statistics as `cas`. It is aimed at desktop users who want to monitor aMule status without a terminal.

Launch with:

```bash
wxcas
```

`wxcas` does not accept command-line arguments; all configuration is done through its Preferences dialog.

`wxcas` polls `amulesig.dat` periodically and refreshes the display automatically. The main window shows:

- **aMule panel**: the seven status lines (version/uptime, server connection, totals, session totals, current rates, shared files/queue, local time).
- **Download records panel**: peak download rate for the current session and the all-time record across all previous sessions.
- **System panel** (Linux only): system load averages (1, 5, 15 minutes) and system uptime.

### Image Generation

`wxcas` can generate a statistics image automatically at every refresh cycle. Supported formats: PNG, JPG, BMP. The output directory is configurable.

**Default output path:** `~/aMule-online-sign.{png,jpg,bmp}` (depending on the configured format). This is distinct from the `cas` default of `~/.aMule/aMule-online-sign.png`.

### FTP Upload

When auto image generation is enabled, `wxcas` can upload the image to an FTP server at a configurable interval. Configure the FTP URL, path, username and password from **Preferences**.

### Preferences

Key settings available in the Preferences dialog:

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| amulesig.dat directory | Directory where aMule writes `amulesig.dat` | `~/.aMule` |
| Refresh rate | How often to re-read `amulesig.dat`, in seconds (1–3600) | `5` |
| Generate stat image | Automatically save a statistics image on each refresh | disabled |
| Image format | PNG, JPG, or BMP | PNG |
| Image directory | Where to save the auto-generated image | `~/` |
| FTP upload | Periodically upload the image to an FTP server | disabled |
| FTP update rate | Upload interval in minutes (1–1440) | `10` |

## CAS — C aMule Statistics

`cas` reads `amulesig.dat` and can produce:

- A formatted text summary on the console.
- A PNG image with statistics overlaid on a background template.
- An HTML page with all statistics.

### Console Output Example

Running `cas` with no arguments prints a status summary similar to:

```
aMule 2.3.3 has been running for 1 D 00 h
user is connected to server.example.com [81.84.97.64:4661] with HighID | Kad: ok
Total Download: 171.36 GB, Upload: 188.96 GB
Session Download: 475.42 MB, Upload: 832.46 MB
Download: 2.3 kB/s, Upload: 10.0 kB/s
Sharing: 98 file(s), Clients on queue: 237
Time: Jan 01 2024, 12:00
```

### Command-Line Options

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `-o`, `--picture`, `-P` | Generate the statistics image (requires libgd at compile time) |
| `-p`, `--html`, `-H` | Generate an HTML statistics page (and the image too if libgd is available) |
| `-c`, `--config-dir DIR` | Read `amulesig.dat` from `DIR` instead of the default aMule config directory |
| `-h`, `--help` | Show usage information |

To write the output to a custom location, use the alias forms that accept a path: `cas -P /path/to/image.png` or `cas -H /path/to/page.html`. With the long options the path must be attached with `=`: `cas --picture=/path/to/image.png`, `cas --html=/path/to/page.html`. The plain `-o` and `-p` short flags take no argument and always use the default location.

Note that `-c DIR` only changes where `amulesig.dat` is **read** from; `casrc` and the generated output files always live in the default config directory (`~/.aMule`).

### Image Generation

When run with the `-o` flag, `cas` generates a PNG image (`~/.aMule/aMule-online-sign.png`) by writing statistics text onto a configurable background image. This option is only available if `cas` was compiled with **libgd** support (see [Compilation](../../developer/compilation/index.md)).

The image is produced by:

1. Loading the background image from `source_image`.
2. Drawing up to seven lines of status text at the positions defined by the placement lines in `casrc`, using the configured font and size. The status lines are taken directly from the corresponding lines of [`amulesig.dat`](../configuration/config-files/index.md#amulesigdat).
3. Saving the result to `~/.aMule/`, as `aMule-online-sign.png` when `img_type` is `0` or `aMule-online-sign.jpg` otherwise (the format and extension follow `img_type` in `casrc`).

Configuration is stored in `~/.aMule/casrc` (see below).

### `casrc` Configuration File {#casrc-configuration-file}

**Location:** `~/.aMule/casrc`. This file is created the first time `cas` is run with the `-o` or `-p` switch, and can be edited manually.

On that first run, `cas` only **creates** the default `casrc`, prints a message asking you to edit it and rerun `cas`, and exits **without** generating the image or HTML page. Run `cas -o` / `cas -p` again (optionally after editing `casrc`) to actually produce the output.

`casrc` uses a key-value format. Each non-empty, non-comment line is either a **parameter** or a **line placement definition**; lines beginning with `#` are comments.

| Parameter | Value | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `font` | Path to a `.ttf` file | Font used to draw text in the generated image |
| `font_size` | Floating-point number | Size of the font (e.g., `10.5`) |
| `source_image` | Path to an image file | Background image on which the text is rendered |
| `template` | Path to an `.html` file | HTML template used to generate the HTML status page |
| `img_type` | `0` or other integer | Output image format: `0` = PNG, any other value = JPG |

After the parameters come the **line placement definitions** that say where each piece of status text is drawn. The first seven placement lines encountered are used (one per status line displayed); any additional lines are ignored. Each has the form `<identifier>  <x>,<y>,<enable>`:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `identifier` | Any text label (`cas` ignores it; it is for human readability only) |
| `x` | Pixels from the **left** edge of the image to the start of the text |
| `y` | Pixels from the **top** edge of the image to the baseline of the text |
| `enable` | `1` to draw this line; `0` to skip it |

Example with all recognized options:

```
# cas config file

# font - full path to a TrueType font file
font /usr/share/fonts/corefonts/times.ttf

# font_size - font size in points
font_size 10.5

# source_image - background image to overlay text on
source_image /usr/share/cas/stat.png

# *_line - x,y,enabled (1=enabled, 0=disabled)
# Each line corresponds to one line of statistics text.
first_line   23,17,1
second_line  23,34,1
third_line   23,51,1
fourth_line  23,68,1
fifth_line   23,85,1
sixth_line   23,102,1
seventh_line 23,119,1

template /usr/share/cas/tmp.html

# img_type - 0 = PNG, any other value = JPG
img_type 0
```

**Default system paths** that `cas` uses when creating a new `casrc`:

| Resource | Default path |
|---|---|
| Font | `/usr/share/fonts/corefonts/times.ttf` |
| Background image | `/usr/share/cas/stat.png` |
| HTML template | `/usr/share/cas/tmp.html` |

### HTML Statistics Page

Run `cas` with the `-p`/`--html` flag to generate `~/.aMule/aMule-online-sign.html`, a full statistics page. It is produced from the HTML template referenced by the `template` parameter in `casrc`, with status values filled in from [`amulesig.dat`](../configuration/config-files/index.md#amulesigdat).

### Generated output files

`cas` creates the following files in `~/.aMule/`, only after it has been run:

| File | Created when | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `casrc` | First run with `-o` or `-p` | CAS configuration (font, background image, HTML template, line placement) |
| `aMule-online-sign.png` | Run with `-o` and `casrc` configured | PNG (or JPG) status image |
| `aMule-online-sign.html` | Run with `-p` | HTML status page |

## Troubleshooting

### `can't open file '/home/user/.aMule/amulesig.dat'`

aMule has not generated the signature file. Fix:

1. In aMule: [**Preferences → Online Signature → Enable Online Signature**](../interfaces/gui/preferences.md#online-signature).
2. Ensure aMule is actually running and connected (the file is only written while aMule is active).
3. If the file still does not appear, check that `~/.aMule/` is writable.
