title: Configuration Files
---

aMule stores its configuration, data, and runtime files in a dedicated directory. Most of these files are compatible with or equivalent to eMule's files. Not all files exist at all times — many are created on demand.

This page is a **catalogue**: what each file is, what it is for, and where to find it. The only files meant to be edited by hand are [`amule.conf`](./amule-conf.md) and [`remote.conf`](./remote-conf.md). For the **on-disk format** of the non-editable files (binary layouts, byte tables, parsing scripts), each entry links to the [File Formats reference](../../../developer/file-formats/index.md) in the Developer Guide.

## Platform paths

| Platform | Directory |
|---|---|
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\aMule\` |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/aMule/` |
| Linux / Unix / BSD | `~/.aMule/` |

On macOS, whenever this reference writes `~/.aMule/`, it means `~/Library/Application Support/aMule/`.

:::note
These are aMule's **configuration** paths. For the **download** directories (Incoming, Temporary, and shared folders), see [Directories](../directories.md).

### Portable configuration (running from a USB drive)

If a directory named `config` exists next to the aMule executable (in its working directory) and already contains an `amule.conf`, aMule reads and writes its configuration there instead of the platform path above. This makes it possible to run a fully self-contained, portable aMule — for example from a USB drive — without touching the host machine's user profile.

## Configuration files

### `amule.conf`

**Location:** `~/.aMule/amule.conf`

This is aMule's main configuration file. It stores virtually all user preferences set through the Preferences dialog — connection limits, directories, interface settings, and more. The format is a standard Windows-style INI file. It is read on startup and written on exit.

`amule.conf.bak` is an automatic backup: on a clean shutdown aMule copies the current `amule.conf` to `amule.conf.bak`, so the previous session's configuration is always available.

A separate `amule.conf.backup` is written only when aMule is started with the `--reset-config` option: the existing configuration is renamed to `amule.conf.backup` before being reset to default values.

See the [amule.conf reference](./amule-conf.md) for the complete key reference and a full example file.

### `remote.conf`

**Location:** `~/.aMule/remote.conf`

Configuration file for the remote tools — the Remote GUI (`amulegui`), `amulecmd`, and `amuleweb`. It stores the External Connections host, port, and password, plus tool-specific settings. The format is a standard INI file.

See the [remote.conf reference](./remote-conf.md) for the complete key reference and a full example file.

### `preferences.dat`

**Location:** `~/.aMule/preferences.dat`

In early eMule versions this file stored all user configuration. In current aMule it stores only two fields: the **configuration file version** and the **userhash** — a 128-bit value that uniquely identifies your client on the eD2k network (used for credit tracking and Secure User Identification).

This file is not meant to be edited by hand. For its binary layout, see the [`preferences.dat` format reference](../../../developer/file-formats/index.md#preferencesdat).

### `preferencesKad.dat`

**Location:** `~/.aMule/preferencesKad.dat`

Stores the client's IP address and its Kademlia ClientID. Both are used to identify the client on the Kad network.

For its binary layout, see the [`preferencesKad.dat` format reference](../../../developer/file-formats/index.md#preferenceskaddat).

### `cryptkey.dat`

**Location:** `~/.aMule/cryptkey.dat`

Contains the client's **384-bit RSA private key**, used for [Secure User Identification](../../../p2p-networks/ed2k/secure-user-identification.md). This key is unique to each client and is generated automatically the first time aMule runs.

:::warning
This file contains your private key. Never share it. If it is compromised, anyone can impersonate your client on the eD2k network.
:::

Keep a backup of this file together with [`preferences.dat`](#preferencesdat): the credits other clients have granted you are tied to both, and losing `cryptkey.dat` loses them. See [Backup and Restore](../../migration/backup-restore.md#credits).

For its storage format, see the [`cryptkey.dat` format reference](../../../developer/file-formats/index.md#cryptkeydat).

## amuleapi files

The [`amuleapi`](../../interfaces/amuleapi/index.md) daemon (REST API and Web UI) keeps its own configuration and credential files in the aMule config directory, alongside `amule.conf`.

### `amuleapi.conf` {#amuleapiconf}

**Location:** `~/.aMule/amuleapi.conf`

`amuleapi`'s configuration file, in standard INI format. It has four sections: `[Server]` (bind address, HTTP port, CORS, static-asset root), `[EC]` (how it reaches the aMule core over External Connections), `[Auth]` (login rate-limiting), and `[Streaming]`. It is created with defaults on first run. This is the only config file `amuleapi` reads — it does **not** use [`remote.conf`](#remoteconf).

See the [amuleapi.conf reference](./amuleapi-conf.md) for the complete key reference and a full example file.

### `amuleapi-passwords` {#amuleapi-passwords}

**Location:** `~/.aMule/amuleapi-passwords`

Shared credential store for the `amuleapi` **admin** and **guest** accounts. Each password is kept as a salted PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 record in PHC string format (`pbkdf2-sha256$<iters>$<salt-hex>$<hash-hex>`); an empty value means the role is unset. The file is created with mode `0600`. It is written by `amuleapi`, [`amuled`](../../interfaces/amuled.md) and the monolithic [`amule`](../../interfaces/gui/amule.md) — but **not** by [`amulegui`](../../interfaces/gui/amulegui.md), which pushes password changes to the core over EC instead. A legacy bare-MD5 record is still accepted and is rewritten to PBKDF2 after the next successful login.

To set or change these passwords, see [Changing Passwords](../../interfaces/amuleapi/index.md#changing-passwords) on the `amuleapi` page.

:::warning
This file holds your `amuleapi` login credentials. Keep its `0600` permissions; on POSIX systems `amuleapi` refuses to start if `amuleapi.conf`, `amuleapi-jwt-secret` or `amuleapi-passwords` has any group or other permission bit set.
:::

### `amuleapi-jwt-secret` {#amuleapi-jwt-secret}

**Location:** `~/.aMule/amuleapi-jwt-secret`

Signing secret for the JWT session tokens `amuleapi` issues. It is auto-generated as 32 random bytes (stored as hex) on first launch, with mode `0600`. Delete the file and restart `amuleapi` to rotate the secret, which invalidates all existing sessions.

### `amuleapi-ec-token` {#amuleapi-ec-token}

**Location:** `~/.aMule/amuleapi-ec-token`

A one-off External Connections login token. When aMule auto-starts `amuleapi` as a child process, it writes this short-lived token (mode `0600`) so the child can authenticate without a stored EC password. `amuleapi` reads and deletes it immediately, and aMule also removes it after a short deadline. It normally exists only for a moment.

### `amuleapi-static/` {#amuleapi-static}

**Location:** installed with aMule (for example `/usr/share/amule/amuleapi-static/`), not in the config directory.

Directory holding the built Web UI assets that `amuleapi` serves. When the `[Server]/StaticRoot` key in `amuleapi.conf` is empty (the default), `amuleapi` auto-discovers this folder — next to its executable, inside the macOS app bundle, or in the shared-data directory. If no assets are found, the REST API still works but `/` returns `404`.

## Network data files

### `server.met`

**Location:** `~/.aMule/server.met`

Binary database of known eD2k servers. Each entry records the server's IP address, TCP port, name, description, ping time, failure count, user count, and capability flags. The format is compatible with eMule's `server.met`. Servers listed in `staticservers.dat` override matching entries here. `server.met.bak` is an automatic backup. During an automatic server-list update, the downloaded list is written to `server_auto.met` first, then merged into `server.met` and deleted on success.

#### Obtaining server.met online

A current `server.met` can be downloaded on first run, when the local list is empty, or when all known servers are unreachable:

| URL | Notes |
|---|---|
| `https://upd.emule-security.org/server.met` | Default URL configured in aMule; maintained by the eMule Security project |
| `https://shortypower.org/server.met` | Aggregated server list |

:::note
These are third-party services unaffiliated with the aMule project. Their availability may change over time.
:::

Enter a URL in the **Networks → eD2k** tab to download immediately, or set `Ed2kServersUrl` in [`amule.conf`](./amule-conf.md) for automatic updates at startup.

For the complete binary format and tag reference, see the [server.met reference](../../../developer/file-formats/server-met.md).

### `staticservers.dat`

**Location:** `~/.aMule/staticservers.dat`

A text file listing eD2k servers that should always be treated as [static servers](../../interfaces/gui/preferences.md). When aMule loads, entries from this file override matching entries in `server.met`. This file is never modified by aMule.

For its line format, see the [`staticservers.dat` format reference](../../../developer/file-formats/index.md#staticserversdat).

### `addresses.dat`

**Location:** `~/.aMule/addresses.dat`

A plain-text list of URLs from which aMule downloads `server.met` files on startup (if the **Auto-update server list at startup** preference is enabled). The downloaded lists are merged into `~/.aMule/server.met`.

For its format, see the [`addresses.dat` format reference](../../../developer/file-formats/index.md#addressesdat).

### `nodes.dat`

**Location:** `~/.aMule/nodes.dat`

Binary file storing known Kademlia contacts used to bootstrap the Kad network on startup.

#### Obtaining nodes.dat online

A fresh `nodes.dat` is useful on first run, when the local file is missing, or when it has become too stale to bootstrap into Kad:

| URL | Notes |
|---|---|
| `https://upd.emule-security.org/nodes.dat` | Default URL configured in aMule; maintained by the eMule Security project |

:::note
This is a third-party service unaffiliated with the aMule project. Its availability may change over time.
:::

Enter a URL in the **Networks → Kad** tab to download immediately, or set `KadNodesUrl` in [`amule.conf`](./amule-conf.md) for automatic updates. Once connected to Kad, aMule keeps `nodes.dat` up to date automatically.

For the complete binary format, see the [nodes.dat reference](../../../developer/file-formats/nodes-dat.md).

### `known.met`

**Location:** `~/.aMule/known.met`

Binary file that caches the hashes, names, sizes, modification dates, priorities, and notes of shared files. This prevents aMule from having to rehash every shared file each time it starts — a significant time saving for large files.

For its format, see the [`known.met` format reference](../../../developer/file-formats/index.md#knownmet).

### `known2_64.met`

**Location:** `~/.aMule/known2_64.met`

Binary file that stores the verified [AICH](../../../p2p-networks/ed2k/aich.md) hashes of shared files. Supports large files (64-bit sizes). This is the successor to the deprecated `known2.met`.

For more detail, see the [`known2_64.met` format reference](../../../developer/file-formats/index.md#known2_64met).

### `clients.met`

**Location:** `~/.aMule/clients.met`

Binary credit ledger: for every peer you have exchanged data with, it records the bytes uploaded and downloaded, used to compute the credits that influence your position in other clients' upload queues. `clients.met.bak` is an automatic backup.

See the [clients.met reference](../../../developer/file-formats/clients-met.md) for the complete binary format.

### `emfriends.met`

**Location:** `~/.aMule/emfriends.met`

Binary file storing your friends list: each entry keeps a friend's userhash, last known IP, port, and timestamps.

See the [emfriends.met reference](../../../developer/file-formats/emfriends-met.md) for the complete binary format.

### `canceled.met`

**Location:** `~/.aMule/canceled.met`

Binary file storing the MD4 hashes of all downloads the user has cancelled. When a file appears in a search result but its hash is listed here, aMule marks it with a distinct colour to indicate it was previously cancelled.

For its format, see the [`canceled.met` format reference](../../../developer/file-formats/index.md#canceledmet).

### `statistics.dat`

**Location:** `~/.aMule/statistics.dat`

Small binary file storing aMule's **lifetime traffic totals** — the cumulative number of bytes ever uploaded and downloaded across all sessions.

For its format, see the [`statistics.dat` format reference](../../../developer/file-formats/index.md#statisticsdat).

## Shared files

### `shareddir.dat`, `shareddir-explicit.dat`, `shareddir-recursive.dat` {#shareddirdat}

aMule uses three related files to track shared directories. For how to configure shared directories from the GUI, see [Directories](../directories.md#shared-directories).

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `shareddir-explicit.dat` | **Canonical.** Non-recursive roots: only the immediate files in each listed directory are shared (subdirectories are not included). |
| `shareddir-recursive.dat` | **Canonical.** Recursive roots: aMule expands each listed directory to include all subdirectories. |
| `shareddir.dat` | **Derived.** Union of the expanded contents of the two canonical files. aMule regenerates this file automatically on every save. External tools that only know `shareddir.dat` (e.g. old scripts or older aMule versions) can still read it. |

When aMule starts and neither `shareddir-explicit.dat` nor `shareddir-recursive.dat` exists (fresh install or migration from an older version), all entries in `shareddir.dat` are loaded as explicit (non-recursive) shares. This is the safe default for migration.

For the shared file format, see the [shared directory files reference](../../../developer/file-formats/index.md#shareddirdat).

## IP filter files

The IP filter blocks all traffic to and from a configurable list of IP addresses and ranges: blocked IPs cannot upload to you or download from you. The list is read from the two files below. aMule's `ipfilter.dat` is 100% compatible with eMule's. To enable and tune the filter, see [Preferences → Security → IP-Filtering](../../interfaces/gui/preferences.md#ip-filtering).

### `ipfilter.dat`

**Location:** `~/.aMule/ipfilter.dat`

Text file containing IP ranges that aMule should block or allow. aMule can auto-update this file by downloading a new one from a configurable URL. During the download, the new data is written to `ipfilter.download` first, then renamed to `ipfilter.dat` on success. The downloaded file may be a ZIP archive; aMule decompresses it automatically and accepts any of the entries named `ipfilter.dat`, `guardian.p2p`, or `guarding.p2p` (the PeerGuardian list filenames). For how to enable and tune the filter, see [Preferences → Security → IP-Filtering](../../interfaces/gui/preferences.md#ip-filtering); for the line format, see the [ipfilter format reference](../../../developer/file-formats/index.md#ipfilterdat).

If the local file cannot be loaded and **Use system-wide ipfilter.dat if available** (`IPFilterSystem`) is enabled, aMule falls back to a system-wide `ipfilter.dat` (on Linux, typically `/usr/share/amule/ipfilter.dat`). This lets a package manager or cron job maintain a shared file, so aMule does not have to re-download a large list at every startup.

#### Obtaining ipfilter.dat online

| URL | Notes |
|---|---|
| `https://upd.emule-security.org/ipfilter.zip` | Maintained by the eMule Security project; distributed as a ZIP archive that aMule decompresses automatically |

:::note
This is a third-party service unaffiliated with the aMule project. Its availability may change over time.
:::

Configure the URL via the `IPFilterURL` key in [`amule.conf`](./amule-conf.md):

```ini
[eMule]
IPFilterURL=https://upd.emule-security.org/ipfilter.zip
```

### `ipfilter_static.dat`

**Location:** `~/.aMule/ipfilter_static.dat`

Same purpose as `ipfilter.dat`, but with two important differences: its entries override conflicting entries in `ipfilter.dat`, and aMule never modifies it. Use it for custom IP ranges that must survive auto-updates.

For its format (identical to `ipfilter.dat`) and the default comment block aMule writes, see the [ipfilter format reference](../../../developer/file-formats/index.md#ipfilterdat).

### Always-filtered ranges (hard-coded)

In addition to the ranges loaded from the files above, aMule **always** blocks the reserved IP ranges defined by [RFC 3330](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3330). These are reserved, special-use, or non-routable addresses that should never appear as eD2k peers. This list is compiled into aMule and **cannot be disabled** by any preference:

```
0.0.0.0/8         "This" Network                     [RFC1700]
39.0.0.0/8        Reserved but subject to allocation [RFC1797]
127.0.0.0/8       Loopback                           [RFC1700]
128.0.0.0/16      Reserved but subject to allocation
169.254.0.0/16    Link Local
191.255.0.0/16    Reserved but subject to allocation
192.0.0.0/24      Reserved but subject to allocation
192.0.2.0/24      Test-Net
192.88.99.0/24    6to4 Relay Anycast                 [RFC3068]
198.18.0.0/15     Network Interconnect Benchmarking  [RFC2544]
223.255.255.0/24  Reserved but subject to allocation
224.0.0.0/4       Multicast                          [RFC3171]
240.0.0.0/4       Reserved for Future Use            [RFC1700]
```

Separately, the private LAN ranges below are blocked **only** when **Always filter LAN IPs** (`FilterLanIPs`, in [`amule.conf`](./amule-conf.md)) is enabled, which is the default:

```
10.0.0.0/8        Private-Use Networks               [RFC1918]
172.16.0.0/12     Private-Use Networks               [RFC1918]
192.168.0.0/16    Private-Use Networks               [RFC1918]
```

## Status and interface files

### `ED2KLinks`

**Location:** `~/.aMule/ED2KLinks`

A plain-text interface for sending commands to a running aMule instance. As soon as aMule detects that this file exists, it reads it, processes each entry, and **deletes the file**. The interface is one-directional (write-only from the user's perspective). It is used by aMule itself to hand [links clicked in a browser or passed on the command line](../ed2k-magnet-links.md#what-happens-when-you-click-a-link) to the running instance, and by the [`ed2k`](../../utilities/ed2k.md) command-line tool.

For its format, see the [`ED2KLinks` format reference](../../../developer/file-formats/index.md#ed2klinks).

### `amulesig.dat` {#amulesigdat}

**Location:** `~/.aMule/amulesig.dat`

aMule's native status signature file: a 17-line text file that external applications (such as the [`cas`](../../utilities/wxcas-cas.md) tool) read to display the client's current status. See the [amulesig.dat reference](../../../developer/file-formats/index.md#amulesigdat) for details.

### `onlinesig.dat` {#onlinesigdat}

**Location:** `~/.aMule/onlinesig.dat`

eMule-compatible 2-line status file. aMule generates it for compatibility with eMule utilities. The native aMule status file is [`amulesig.dat`](#amulesigdat), which carries far more information.

For its format, see the [`onlinesig.dat` format reference](../../../developer/file-formats/index.md#onlinesigdat).

### `muleLock`

**Location:** `~/.aMule/muleLock`

Plain-text file containing the PID of the currently running aMule process. It is created when aMule starts and deleted when aMule exits normally.

On startup, aMule checks whether `muleLock` exists. If it does, aMule reads the PID and checks whether a process with that PID is currently running. If one is found, aMule refuses to start, preventing two simultaneous instances for the same user.

:::note
aMule does not verify that the running process is actually another aMule. Any process with the stored PID will block startup. If `muleLock` is left behind after a crash, delete it manually before restarting aMule.
:::

The Remote GUI (`amulegui`) uses its own lock file, `muleLockRGUI`, with the same mechanism, so a local aMule instance and the Remote GUI do not block each other.

### `geoip.mmdb` {#geoip-mmdb}

**Location:** `~/.aMule/geoip.mmdb`

Country database in **MaxMind DB format** (`.mmdb`), used by [IP2Country](../ip2country.md) to show the country flag of clients and servers. aMule downloads it from the selected provider (DB-IP by default) and keeps it up to date, so it normally needs no manual handling; see [IP2Country → The database file](../ip2country.md#the-database-file) to install one by hand.

While an update is downloading, aMule writes `geoip.mmdb.download` and renames it to `geoip.mmdb` once it is complete. A leftover `.download` file after a failed update can be deleted.

### `searchhistory.dat` {#searchhistorydat}

**Location:** `~/.aMule/searchhistory.dat`

Plain-text list of the last 100 search terms, one per line, newest first. The GUI rewrites it after every search and reads it to fill the **Name** drop-down of the [Searches](../../interfaces/gui/searches.md#search-history) window. In [`amulegui`](../../interfaces/gui/amulegui.md) it is written in the remote GUI's own configuration directory; `amuled` does not create it. It is only used while **Remember search history** is enabled (`SearchHistoryEnabled` in [`amule.conf`](./amule-conf.md)); disabling the option leaves the file in place, and **Clear Search History** deletes it.

### `StoredSearches.met` {#storedsearchesmet}

**Location:** `~/.aMule/StoredSearches.met`

Binary file with the results of the searches still open when the core (`amule` or `amuled`) shuts down — at most the 20 most recent searches and 5000 results each; "View Files" listings are not saved. The core reads it on the next start to reopen those searches (see [Saved Searches](../../interfaces/gui/searches.md#saved-searches)). It is written only while **Remember search history** is enabled; with the option disabled, the file is deleted on the next start.

## Log files

### `logfile`

**Location:** `~/.aMule/logfile`

Plain-text log of the current aMule session, capturing all messages, warnings, and errors reported during operation. When a new session starts, the previous `logfile` is renamed to `logfile.bak` and a fresh one is created. Each line is prefixed with a `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS:` timestamp.

The [`amulegui`](../../interfaces/gui/amulegui.md) writes its own separate log to `~/.aMule/remotelogfile`, in the same format but recording only events from the GUI process.

## Version tracking files

### `lastversion`

**Location:** `~/.aMule/lastversion`

Plain-text file recording the last 10 aMule versions launched on this machine, in reverse chronological order (most recent first), one version string per line. aMule uses it to detect version upgrades and show first-run messages. When an 11th version is added, the oldest entry is dropped.

### `last_version_check`

**Location:** `~/.aMule/last_version_check`

File holding the response of aMule's update check. aMule queries the GitHub Releases API (`https://api.github.com/repos/amule-org/amule/releases/latest`) and stores the returned JSON here; it then extracts the `tag_name` field and compares it with the running version to notify the user of updates. On a successful download the file is renamed to `last_version`.

This replaces the legacy single-line `lastversion` text file that was fetched from SourceForge, which has been unmaintained since the project moved to GitHub.

### `last_version_notified`

**Location:** `~/.aMule/last_version_notified`

Single-line plain-text file holding the release version for which the user ticked **Don't ask again** in the [New version available](../../../quickstart-guide.md#version-check) dialog. aMule does not show the dialog for that version again, but a newer release shows it once more. The file is written only when the checkbox is ticked; delete it to be reminded of the muted version again.

## Kademlia index files

### `key_index.dat`, `src_index.dat` and `load_index.dat` {#kad-index-files}

**Location:** `~/.aMule/key_index.dat`, `~/.aMule/src_index.dat`, `~/.aMule/load_index.dat`

Binary files that store the Kademlia network index data this client maintains as a node of the Kad network:

- `key_index.dat` — keyword index: the keywords this client publishes so other clients can search for files through it.
- `src_index.dat` — source index: the sources (which clients hold which files) this client publishes.
- `load_index.dat` — keyIDs of known Kademlia clients with their last-seen dates, used to gauge network load.

All three are internal to the Kad implementation and are not intended for manual editing.

For more detail, see the [Kad index files format reference](../../../developer/file-formats/index.md#key_indexdat-and-load_indexdat).

## CAS files

### `casrc`, `aMule-online-sign.html`, `aMule-online-sign.png` {#cas-files}

Files used by the [`cas`](../../utilities/wxcas-cas.md) status-image tool: `casrc` is its configuration, and `aMule-online-sign.html` / `aMule-online-sign.png` are the HTML and PNG status outputs it generates. See the [`cas` / `wxcas` documentation](../../utilities/wxcas-cas.md) for details.

## Temporary download files

### `*.part`, `*.part.met` and related {#temporary-download-files}

Each in-progress download in the `Temp/` directory is represented by a group of files: `*.part` (the partial data), `*.part.met` (metadata: hashes, verified chunks, tags), `*.part.met.bak` (recovery backup of `*.part.met`), `*.part.met.tmp` (short-lived write-in-progress temp), and `*.part.met.seeds` (up to 10 sources for rare files).

See the [Temporary download files reference](../../../developer/file-formats/part-met.md) for the complete formats.
