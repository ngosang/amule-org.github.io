id: amule-conf
title: amule.conf
---

`amule.conf` is aMule's main configuration file. It stores every preference that can be set through the Preferences dialog, plus internal state such as window geometry and table column widths.

**Location:**

| Platform | Path |
|---|---|
| Linux / Unix | `~/.aMule/amule.conf` |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/aMule/amule.conf` |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\aMule\amule.conf` |

A backup copy is written to `amule.conf.bak` each time the file is saved.

## Format

`amule.conf` uses standard Windows INI format:
- Settings are `key=value` pairs, one per line.
- Keys are grouped into **sections** identified by `[SectionName]` headers.
- Any text following a `#` character is a comment and is ignored.
- Boolean keys use `0` (false / disabled) and `1` (true / enabled).
- `0` for speed limits means unlimited.
- Passwords are stored as MD5 hashes.

aMule writes this file on exit and reads it on startup. Manual edits take effect on the next startup.

## `[eMule]` section

## `[UserEvents]` section {#userevents-section}

Shell commands executed when specific events occur. This page documents only the file structure and keys; for the full description of each event, the available substitution variables, command syntax and ready-made example scripts, see the [Events](../events.md) page.

:::note
aMule writes an empty `[UserEvents]` section header in the file before the event subsections. This is a wxFileConfig artifact (parent group written before child groups) and carries no configuration of its own.
:::

Each event is stored as a subsection of `[UserEvents]`. For example, the "Download completed" event uses the section `[UserEvents/DownloadCompleted]`. Each event has four keys:

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `CoreEnabled` | `0` | Execute the core command when this event fires. |
| `CoreCommand` | _(empty)_ | Shell command run by [`amuled`](../../interfaces/amuled.md) or the monolithic [`amule`](../../interfaces/gui/amule.md) binary. |
| `GUIEnabled` | `0` | Execute the GUI command when this event fires. |
| `GUICommand` | _(empty)_ | Shell command run by the GUI component. |

### Events and their sections

| Section | Event |
|---|---|

| `[UserEvents/NewChatSession]` | New chat session started |
| `[UserEvents/OutOfDiskSpace]` | Out of disk space |
| `[UserEvents/ErrorOnCompletion]` | Error on completion |

See the [Events](../events.md) page for the substitution variables available to each event, the command syntax (aMule does not run commands through a shell) and ready-made example scripts.

## `[Statistics]` section

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `MaxClientVersions` | `0` | Maximum number of client version entries to show in the statistics tree (`0` = unlimited). |

## `[SkinGUIOptions]` section

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `Skin` | _(empty)_ | Path to the skin `.zip` file used to customise aMule's bitmaps. Empty = no skin (default appearance). |

## `[GUI]`, `[GUI/TransferWnd]` and `[GUI/SharedWnd]` sections

Window and panel layout settings. Written and read by aMule automatically; not intended for manual editing.

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `HideOnClose` | `0` | Hide the main window to the tray instead of quitting when the window is closed. Requires `EnableTrayIcon=1`. |
| `AppImageIntegrationDeclined` | `0` | Set to `1` if the user has declined the AppImage `.desktop` integration prompt. Written automatically; do not edit. |
| `[GUI/TransferWnd] Splitter` | `463` | Vertical splitter position (pixels) in the Downloads window. |
| `[GUI/TransferWnd] ShowClientList` | `1` | Show the client list panel in the Downloads window. |
| `[GUI/SharedWnd] Splitter` | `463` | Vertical splitter position (pixels) in the Shared Files window. |
| `[GUI/SharedWnd] ShowClientList` | `1` | Show the client list panel in the Shared Files window. |
| `[GUI/SharedWnd] ClientShowMode` | `1` | Which clients the Shared Files client list shows. `0` = clients of all shared files, `1` = clients of the selected file only. |

## `[General]` section

Stores the number of download categories and their definitions.

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `Count` | `0` | Number of additional download categories (not counting the default "All" category). |

Each category is stored as a `[Cat#N]` subsection (N = 1, 2, …):

| Key | Description |
|---|---|
| `Title` | Category name. |
| `Incoming` | Directory where files in this category are saved. |
| `Comment` | Optional notes. |
| `Color` | Category colour (stored as a decimal integer). |
| `Priority` | Default priority for downloads in this category. |

## `[HTTPDownload]` section

Internal cache written and managed by aMule automatically. **Do not edit manually.**

aMule uses this section to implement **conditional GET**: before downloading a file, it checks whether the URL matches the last successful download for that type. If it does and the local file exists, aMule sends an `If-Modified-Since` HTTP header — the server responds with `304 Not Modified` if the file has not changed, saving bandwidth.

Each key stores the last URL that was successfully downloaded for one specific resource type:

| Key | Resource type | Enum value |
|---|---|---|
| `URL_1` | IP filter (`ipfilter.dat` / `ipfilter.zip`) | `HTTP_IPFilter` |
| `URL_2` | Server list ([`server.met`](../../../developer/file-formats/server-met.md)) — manual download | `HTTP_ServerMet` |
| `URL_3` | Server list ([`server.met`](../../../developer/file-formats/server-met.md)) — auto-update from `addresses.dat` | `HTTP_ServerMetAuto` |
| `URL_4` | Version check file (`last_version_check`) | `HTTP_VersionCheck` |
| `URL_5` | Kademlia nodes list ([`nodes.dat`](../../../developer/file-formats/nodes-dat.md)) | `HTTP_NodesDat` |
| `URL_6` | GeoIP database (`GeoLite2-Country.mmdb`) | `HTTP_GeoIP` |

Keys are only written after a successful download. A key that was never written (or whose URL has changed) simply causes a full download without the `If-Modified-Since` optimisation.

## `[Debug]` section

:::warning Debug builds only
This section is only read and written by aMule when compiled with the `__DEBUG__` flag (debug builds). It has no effect in release builds. See `VerboseDebug` and `VerboseDebugLogfile` in the [`[eMule]` Debugging subsection](#debugging) for the release-build logging controls.
:::

Each key enables or disables one debug log category. A value of `1` enables verbose output for that subsystem; `0` disables it. Categories only produce output when `VerboseDebug=1` is also set in `[eMule]`.

Key format: `Cat_<name>` where `<name>` is the exact category name, including spaces.

:::note
wxFileConfig (the INI library used by aMule) escapes spaces in key names with a backslash when writing to disk. A key like `Cat_ED2k Client` appears in the file as `Cat_ED2k\ Client`. Both forms refer to the same key; aMule reads and writes them correctly either way.
