title: amulegui — Remote GUI
---

`amulegui` is a standalone graphical client that connects to a running [`amuled`](../amuled.md) (or to a monolithic [`amule`](./amule.md) core) over the network using the [External Connections (EC) protocol](../../../developer/ec-protocol.md). It provides almost the same interface as the `amule` client, but without running the core locally.

## Overview

`amulegui` is the preferred option when you want a full graphical interface to a headless `amuled` running on a remote machine, or on the same machine in a different session. Because the core runs as a separate process, you can keep `amuled` running 24/7 and attach or detach the GUI whenever you like.

If your connection to the `amuled` host is slow or unreliable, consider using [`amulecmd`](../amulecmd.md) (CLI) or the [`amuleapi` Web UI](../amuleapi/web-ui.md) (browser) instead, as those interfaces transfer less data per interaction.

### Known Limitations

- Feature parity with the local `amule` GUI is the design goal but may lag behind in practice. Settings the remote GUI cannot apply to the core are hidden in its [Preferences](#preferences-in-amulegui).
- The **Import** [toolbar](./toolbar.md) button is not available (see [Import Tool](../../migration/import-tool.md)).

## Installation

See [Installation](../../installation/index.md) for pre-built packages, or [Compilation](../../../developer/compilation/index.md) to build `amulegui` from source.

## Configuration

Before `amulegui` can connect, the core (`amuled` or `amule`) must have External Connections enabled and a password configured.

### Configuring the core

1. In [`~/.aMule/amule.conf`](../../configuration/config-files/amule-conf.md), set:

   ```ini
   [ExternalConnect]
   AcceptExternalConnections=1
   ECPassword=<md5hash>
   ECPort=4712
   ```

2. Generate the MD5 hash of your chosen password:

   ```bash
   echo -n yourpassword | md5sum | cut -d ' ' -f 1
   ```

   Paste the result (without trailing whitespace) as the value of `ECPassword`.

3. By default, a new configuration makes the core listen only on the local machine (`ECAddress=127.0.0.1`); a configuration created by an older version keeps its previous value (usually empty = all interfaces). To connect `amulegui` from another computer, set `ECAddress` to the core's LAN IP address, or leave it empty to listen on all interfaces:

   ```ini
   ECAddress=
   ```

### Connecting `amulegui` to the core

When `amulegui` starts, it presents the **Connect to remote amule** dialog.

![amulegui connection dialog](/img/docs/gui_amulegui/amulegui_connect.png)

Enter:
- **Connect to** — hostname or IP address of the machine running the core (default: `127.0.0.1`), and after the colon the EC port (default: `4712`).
- **Password** — the plaintext password (not the MD5 hash); `amulegui` hashes it internally before sending. A non-empty password is required.
- **Encrypt the connection (recommended)** — encrypt all EC traffic between `amulegui` and the core. Ticked by default. A core with **Require encrypted connections** enabled in its [Remote Controls preferences](./preferences.md#remote-controls) refuses unencrypted connections.
- **Force ZLIB compression** — traffic is compressed with zlib by default, except when the core resolves to a local/LAN address (where compression is skipped); tick this to compress regardless — useful when the core is reachable over a VPN tunnel that resolves to a LAN IP.

Leave **Remember those settings** ticked (the default) to store the host, port, hashed password and the two checkbox choices (persisted as [`/EC/Encryption` and `/EC/ForceZLIB`](../../configuration/config-files/remote-conf.md#ec-section)) so they are reused on the next launch. With saved settings in place you can start with the `-s`/`--skip` flag (see below) to bypass the dialog entirely.

If the connection fails or times out, see [Remote Access Troubleshooting](../../troubleshooting/remote-access.md).

## Interface

Once connected, the interface is the same as the monolithic `amule` client, with the same panels (Networks, Searches, Downloads, Shared Files, Clients, Messages, Statistics). Full documentation for each panel is in the [GUI](./index.md) guides. The remote-specific behaviour is described below.

### Core version

The [status bar](./statusbar.md#core-version-amulegui) shows the version of the connected core as **Core: &lt;version&gt;**, in red when it differs from the version of `amulegui` itself. Click it to open a **Version** window with the core's address, whether the connection is encrypted, and both versions.

### Losing the connection

If the connection to the core drops (or the core sends no reply for 30 seconds while requests are pending), `amulegui` does not exit. The interface is paused and a **Connection lost** window shows the reconnection progress: `amulegui` retries every 5 seconds until the core is reachable again, then resumes where it left off (it reloads everything if the core was restarted meanwhile). Click **Abort and exit** to give up and close `amulegui`.

While the window is minimized or hidden in the [system tray](./tray-icon.md), the reconnection runs silently, without the dialog; it appears if you restore the window before the connection is back. Each step is also logged.

### Server Info, window layout and logs

The **Server Info** tab of the Networks window is filled with the core's server messages, and `amulegui` remembers its window size and position and the column layout of every list between sessions.

The [Networks](./networks.md#amule-log) window's **aMule Log** tab shows the core's log, while a separate [**aMuleGUI Log**](./networks.md#amulegui-log) tab holds the messages of `amulegui` itself — connection, reconnection and local errors. `amulegui` also writes its own log to `remotelogfile` in its configuration directory, next to [`remote.conf`](../../configuration/config-files/remote-conf.md).

### Shared folders

In **[Preferences → Directories](./preferences.md#directories)**, the local directory tree is replaced by the list of folders shared by the core. Type an absolute path as seen on the core's machine, tick **Recursive** to also share its sub-folders, and click **Add**; select an entry and click **Remove** to stop sharing it.

### Opening files and path mappings

**Open the file**, **Preview** and **Show in file manager** in the [Downloads](./downloads.md#controlling-downloads) and [Shared Files](./shared-files.md#other-menu-options) windows work only on files this computer can reach. When the core runs on another machine, add a [Path Mapping](./preferences.md#path-mappings) that rewrites the core's path prefix (e.g. `/srv/amule/Incoming`) to where the same folder is mounted locally (e.g. a network share). The mappings are stored in the [`[PathMappings]` section](../../configuration/config-files/remote-conf.md#pathmappings-section) of `remote.conf`.

### Searches and chat

Kad searches can be widened with **Extend**, searches started from other interfaces appear as tabs, and **View Files** shows a client's shares as a [folder tree](./searches.md#browsing-a-clients-shared-files), the same as in `amule` (see [Searches](./searches.md)). Chat sessions are held by the core, so conversations continue across `amulegui` sessions (see [Chat in `amulegui`](./messages.md#chat-in-amulegui)).

### Preferences in `amulegui`

The Preferences window only offers settings the core can apply over EC. It adds the [Path Mappings](./preferences.md#path-mappings) page, which is specific to `amulegui`, and hides or disables, among others, the External Connections settings of the core, the web server and External Connections UPnP options (always), the P2P UPnP options when the core has no UPnP support, the online-signature and `ffprobe` **Browse** buttons, the `ffprobe` **Detect** button, and the [**IP2Country**](../../configuration/ip2country.md) page when the core has no GeoIP support.

You can also pass one or more [eD2k links](../../../p2p-networks/ed2k/links.md), `magnet:` links or `.emulecollection` files as arguments to enqueue them into the connected core:

```bash
amulegui -t 1 "ed2k://|file|example.iso|123456|<hash>|/"
```
