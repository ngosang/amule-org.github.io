| **Default Permissions — Files** | Permissions assigned to newly created files. Note: this may conflict with your system `umask`. |
| **Default Permissions — Directories** | Permissions assigned to newly created directories. Note: this may conflict with your system `umask`. |

### IP-Filtering

The IP filter blocks all traffic to and from a configurable list of IP addresses and ranges, read from
[`ipfilter.dat` and `ipfilter_static.dat`](../../configuration/config-files/index.md#ip-filter-files).
Each option below maps to a key in [`amule.conf`](../../configuration/config-files/amule-conf.md).

| Setting | Description |
|---|---|
| **Filter clients** | Apply the IP filter to client connections (`IpFilterClients`). |
| **Filter servers** | Apply the IP filter to server connections (`IpFilterServers`). |
| **Reload List** | Reload `ipfilter.dat` and `ipfilter_static.dat` from disk and re-check all active connections. |
| **URL** | URL of the `ipfilter.dat` file to download (`IPFilterURL`). |
| **Update now** | Download the filter from the **URL** immediately. |
| **Auto-update ipfilter at startup** | Download an updated filter from the **URL** every time aMule starts (`IPFilterAutoLoad`). |
| **Filtering Level** | Filter level, 0–255 (default 127). A range is blocked when its access level is **strictly less than** this value, so a higher level blocks more ranges and a lower level blocks fewer (`FilterLevel`). |
| **Always filter LAN IPs** | Always block IPs that claim to be in a local LAN range (`FilterLanIPs`). See [always-filtered ranges](../../configuration/config-files/index.md#always-filtered-ranges-hard-coded). |
| **Paranoid handling of non-matching IPs** | Reject a packet if the client IP differs from the IP it was received from. Use with caution (`ParanoidFiltering`). |
| **Use system-wide ipfilter.dat if available** | If the local `ipfilter.dat` cannot be loaded, fall back to the [system-wide file](../../configuration/config-files/index.md#ip-filter-files) (`IPFilterSystem`). |

aMule always blocks the reserved RFC 3330 IP ranges regardless of these settings; see
[always-filtered ranges](../../configuration/config-files/index.md#always-filtered-ranges-hard-coded).

### Identification
