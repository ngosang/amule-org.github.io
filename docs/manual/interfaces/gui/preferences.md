| **Add files to download with auto priority** | Newly added downloads get automatic priority. |
| **Try to download first and last chunks first** | Always try to download the beginning and end of files first. Useful for previewing audio and video files. |
| **Start next paused file when a file completes** | When a file completes, automatically resume the highest-priority paused file. |
| **From the same category** | When the above option is enabled, resume the highest-priority paused file in the same category (if one exists). |
| **In alphabetic order** | When resuming the next paused file, pick it in alphabetic order instead of by priority. |
| **Preallocate disk space for new files** | Reserve the full file size on disk when a download starts, reducing fragmentation. |
| **Stop downloads when free disk space reaches _n_ MB** | Pause downloads when free disk space would fall below the given minimum (in MB). See [Disk Space Protection](../../configuration/directories.md#disk-space-protection). |
| **Save 10 sources on rare files (< 20 sources)** | On shutdown, save 10 sources for files with few sources so they can be reused on next startup. |

### Uploads

| Setting | Description |
|---|---|
| **Add new shared files with auto priority** | Files added to shared directories, or completed downloads, get automatic share priority. |

See [Events](../../configuration/events.md) for a flexible event system that can run a command when a download completes, plus chat notifications and disk-space alerts.

## Security

Options for aMule's security features, including protocol obfuscation and IP filtering.

![Security preferences tab](/img/docs/gui_preferences/preferences_security.png)

| Setting | Description |
|---|---|
| **Use Secure User Identification** | Use the [Secure User Identification](../../../p2p-networks/ed2k/secure-user-identification.md) protocol when identifying to other clients. Recommended. |

### Protocol Obfuscation

| Setting | Description |
|---|---|
| **Support Protocol Obfuscation** | Enable protocol obfuscation, which disguises aMule traffic to make it harder to detect and throttle. |
| **Use obfuscation for outgoing connections** | Initiate outgoing connections using obfuscation when supported by the remote client. |
| **Accept only obfuscated connections** | Reject incoming connections that are not obfuscated. |

| Setting | Description |
|---|---|
| **Who can see my shared files** | Controls who can browse your shared files: **Everybody**, **Friends**, or **No one**. Hiding them from everyone is recommended. |

### IP-Filtering

The IP filter blocks all traffic to and from a configurable list of IP addresses and ranges, read from [`ipfilter.dat` and `ipfilter_static.dat`](../../configuration/config-files/index.md#ip-filter-files). Each option below maps to a key in [`amule.conf`](../../configuration/config-files/amule-conf.md).

| Setting | Description |
|---|---|
| **Filter clients** | Apply the IP filter to client connections (`IpFilterClients`). |
| **Filter servers** | Apply the IP filter to server connections (`IpFilterServers`). |
| **Reload List** | Reload `ipfilter.dat` and `ipfilter_static.dat` from disk and re-check all active connections. |
| **URL** | URL of the `ipfilter.dat` file to download (`IPFilterURL`). |
| **Update now** | Download the filter from the **URL** immediately. |
| **Auto-update ipfilter at startup** | Download an updated filter from the **URL** every time aMule starts (`IPFilterAutoLoad`). |
| **Filtering Level** | Filter level, 0–255 (default 127). A range is blocked when its access level is **strictly less than** this value, so a higher level blocks more ranges and a lower level blocks fewer (`FilterLevel`). |
| **Always filter LAN IPs** | Always block IPs that claim to be in a local LAN range (`FilterLanIPs`). See [always-filtered ranges](../../configuration/config-files/index.md#always-filtered-ranges-hard-coded). |
| **Paranoid handling of non-matching IPs** | Reject a packet if the client IP differs from the IP it was received from. Use with caution (`ParanoidFiltering`). |
| **Use system-wide ipfilter.dat if available** | If the local `ipfilter.dat` cannot be loaded, fall back to the [system-wide file](../../configuration/config-files/index.md#ip-filter-files) (`IPFilterSystem`). |

aMule always blocks the reserved RFC 3330 IP ranges regardless of these settings; see [always-filtered ranges](../../configuration/config-files/index.md#always-filtered-ranges-hard-coded).
