If you are switching to aMule from another eD2k client and the two clients use incompatible temporary file formats, you cannot simply copy the `.part` files from one client's temp directory to the other. This guide describes a universal method to transfer in-progress downloads between any two eD2k clients using a local connection.

:::note
This issue primarily affects migrations from **mlDonkey**, **eDonkey2000**, and certain **xMule** versions. eMule's format is directly compatible with aMule; see [Migrate from eMule](migrate-from-emule.md) instead.

For eDonkey2000 specifically, aMule also includes a built-in import tool — see [Import](import.md).

## When This Is Needed

You need this procedure when:

- You are moving from a client whose temporary file format is not compatible with aMule's.
- Direct file format conversion tools are not available for your specific client combination.
- You want a universal solution that works regardless of which two eD2k clients are involved.

## Procedure

The method uses the eD2k protocol itself to transfer the data: you set up a local peer-to-peer session between the old client (source) and aMule (destination) on the same machine or local network. Because both use the same eD2k protocol, the transfer is format-agnostic.

### Step 1 — Set Up a Testing Field

First, set up a local eD2k network environment (see the Testing Field guide in the Development section) so both clients can connect without touching the real public network.

### Step 2 — Transfer the Downloads

With both clients running on the local network, use one of these approaches:

**Option A — Search and re-add:**

1. In aMule, perform a **local search** for each file you were downloading in the old client.
2. Add each result to the aMule download queue.
3. aMule connects to the old client (which has partial data) and downloads from it at LAN speed.

**Option B — Copy ed2k links:**

1. In the old client, copy the `ed2k://` link for each file in the download queue.
2. Paste each link into aMule's **ED2K-Link Handler** or the `ED2KLinks` file (`~/.aMule/ED2KLinks`).
3. aMule adds them to its queue and downloads from the old client.

Because both clients are on the same machine or LAN, the transfer happens at disk/LAN speed rather than internet speed.

### Step 3 — Remove the Old Client

Once all files have been fully downloaded to aMule, remove the old client from your system.

## Advantages

- **Universal**: works between any two eD2k clients, since they all speak the same protocol.
- **Fast**: transfers happen at LAN or disk speed rather than internet bandwidth.

## Disadvantages

- **Chunk boundary losses**: the eD2k protocol transfers data in complete chunks. Any partially filled chunk at the end of a download segment must be re-downloaded. In most cases this means losing approximately 5% or less of already-downloaded data.
- **Worst case for small files**: if you have many files smaller than ~10 MB, the loss of a single incomplete chunk can represent 90% or more of the file's data (or even 100% in extreme cases). In such cases it may be faster to finish downloading those specific files in the old client before switching to aMule.
- **Temporary disk space**: you need free disk space for both the original temporary files and the new aMule temporary files simultaneously. To minimise this, import one file at a time and delete the old temporary file after each successful import.

## Alternative: aMule's Import Tool

aMule includes an optimised **Import** tool that can directly read some clients' temporary file formats without a peer-to-peer transfer. See [Import](import.md) for details.

## Alternative: mlDonkey Importer Script

aMule ships with a Perl script for importing mlDonkey temporary files:

```
src/utils/scripts/mldonkey_importer.pl
```

This script is available in the aMule source tree and provides a direct format conversion for mlDonkey files without needing the network-transfer approach.
