### Speed Bar

A vertical bar on the right side of the icon shows the **current download speed as a percentage** of the maximum download bandwidth configured in Preferences:

The higher the bar, the closer to the configured maximum download speed.

### Mule Head Colour

The mule head in the icon indicates the overall connection status:

| Icon | Meaning |
|---|---|
| ![Not connected](/img/docs/usage/window_systray4.jpg) | Not connected to any network |
| ![Low ID](/img/docs/usage/window_systray5.jpg) | Connected to one or more networks, but all connections have [Low ID](../../ed2k/high-id-low-id.md) |
| ![High ID](/img/docs/usage/window_systray6.jpg) | Connected to one or more networks with at least one [High ID](../../ed2k/high-id-low-id.md) connection |

## Tooltip

Hovering over the tray icon for a few seconds shows a tooltip:

The tooltip has this format:

```
