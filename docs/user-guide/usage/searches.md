The Searches window lets you search for files across the eD2k and Kademlia networks and add results directly to your download queue.

## Overview

![Search window overview](/img/docs/usage/window_search1.jpg)

The window is divided into two main areas. The **upper area** (highlighted in red) contains the search controls:

![Search controls area](/img/docs/usage/window_search2.jpg)

The **lower area** displays search results:

![Search results area](/img/docs/usage/window_search3.jpg)

## Basic Searching

### Starting a Search

Type what you want to find in the **Name** field and click **Start**:

![Name field and Start button](/img/docs/usage/window_search4.jpg)

Search queries are matched against file names. For example:
- `amule` — finds files whose name contains "amule"
- `debian iso` — finds files whose name contains both "debian" and "iso"

For details on how the search logic works (AND, OR, NOT), see [Search types](#search-type) below.

### Getting Results

Once a search starts, a results tab appears:

![Results tab](/img/docs/usage/window_search5.jpg)

The results list shows, for each file: **filename**, **size**, **sources** (total sources and, in brackets, sources with the complete file), **type**, and **file ID**:

![Results list with columns](/img/docs/usage/window_search6.jpg)

When no files are found for the query, the results tab is empty.

For **global searches**, a progress bar appears showing how far the search has progressed:

![Global search progress bar](/img/docs/usage/window_search35.jpg)

### Stopping a Search

Click the **Stop** button to halt an active search:

![Stop button](/img/docs/usage/window_search18.jpg)

Alternatively, close the active tab (described in [Tabs](#tabs) below).

## Downloading from Results

Once results appear there are three ways to start a download.

### Download Button

Select one or more files in the results list and click the **Download** button:

![Download button](/img/docs/usage/window_search7.jpg)

This method supports downloading multiple files in a single click.

### Double-Click or Enter Key

Double-click a single file, or select it and press **Enter**:

![Double-click to download](/img/docs/usage/window_search8.jpg)

:::note
Double-clicking or pressing Enter downloads only the file you double-clicked on, not all selected files. The selection is also cleared.
:::

### Right-Click Menu (Extended Options)

Right-click on one or more selected files and choose **Download** or **Download in category**:

![Right-click download menu](/img/docs/usage/window_search21.jpg)

Using **Download in category** lets you assign the file(s) to a specific download category at the moment of queuing:

![Download in category submenu](/img/docs/usage/window_search22.jpg)

:::note
This method is not available to macOS users with a single-button mouse (no right-click). Use [Ctrl+Click](macos.md) as an alternative.
:::

### Result Row Colours

Files in the results list are colour-coded:

| Colour | Meaning |
|---|---|
| ![Green](/img/docs/usage/window_search45.jpg) Green | Already downloaded or currently shared by you |
| ![Red](/img/docs/usage/window_search43.jpg) Red | Already in the download queue |
| Dark blue / black | Not downloaded and not in queue; fewer sources |
| ![Light blue](/img/docs/usage/window_search44.jpg) Light blue | Not downloaded and not in queue; more sources |

The lighter the blue, the more sources the file has. Some search results may also display an **average rating** (when the server provides it). Comments are never shown in search results, only average ratings.

## Tabs

Each search opens its own **results tab**:

![Single search tab](/img/docs/usage/window_search10.jpg)

Starting a new search creates an additional tab; previous tabs remain accessible in the background:

![Multiple search tabs](/img/docs/usage/window_search11.jpg)

The tab label shows the search text you entered:

![Tab label with search text](/img/docs/usage/window_search12.jpg)

Clicking any tab shows the results for that particular search, allowing you to compare multiple searches simultaneously:

![Switching between tabs](/img/docs/usage/window_search13.jpg)

The number in brackets next to the search text is the result count:

![Result count in tab](/img/docs/usage/window_search14.jpg)

When a **filter** is active (see [Filtering](#filtering) below), the count appears as `N/M`, where `M` is the total number of results received and `N` is the number currently passing through the filter:

![Filtered result count N/M](/img/docs/usage/window_search41.jpg)

### Closing a Tab

Click the **X** button on the left side of a tab to close it. Closing a tab also stops its search if it is still running:

![Close tab X button](/img/docs/usage/window_search15.jpg)

### Scrolling Tabs

When there are more tabs than fit in the window, scroll arrows appear on both ends of the tab bar:

![Tab scroll arrows](/img/docs/usage/window_search20.jpg)

### Tab Right-Click Menu

Right-clicking a tab reveals three options:

![Tab right-click menu](/img/docs/usage/window_search38.jpg)

| Option | Action |
|---|---|
| Close tab | Close the clicked tab |

## Advanced Searching

![Invert result checkbox](/img/docs/usage/window_search27.jpg)
