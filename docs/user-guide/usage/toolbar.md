The toolbar provides one-click access to all major aMule windows and to the connect/disconnect action. It is normally positioned at the top of the main window but can be moved to the left side through **Preferences → General → Toolbar orientation**.

When positioned on the left side:

## Buttons

### Connect / Disconnect

The leftmost button connects and disconnects aMule from all enabled networks. The networks that aMule is allowed to connect to are configured in **Preferences → Connections**.

**Disconnected** — when aMule is not connected to any network the button shows a connect icon:

![Connect button](/img/docs/usage/window_toolbar9.jpg)

Clicking it starts a connection attempt to all allowed networks. If no network is explicitly allowed, aMule defaults to the eD2k network. While connecting, the button changes to a **Cancel** button:

Clicking Cancel while connecting aborts the attempt and returns aMule to the disconnected state.

**Connected** — once aMule connects to at least one network the button becomes a **Disconnect** button:

Clicking it disconnects aMule from all networks immediately.
