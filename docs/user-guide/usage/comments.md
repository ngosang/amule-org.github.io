aMule supports a per-file comment and rating system. Other clients on the network can attach short text comments and quality ratings to files they are sharing. This helps you judge the quality of a file before completing its download — and detect fakes, corrupt files, or low-quality content.

## Comment/Rating Icons in the Download Queue

When aMule receives comment or rating information about a file in your download queue, an icon appears next to the file name. The icon reflects the average rating reported by sources:

| Icon | Meaning |
|---|---|
| ![Comment but no rating](/img/docs/usage/comments1.jpg) | A comment exists but the file has not been rated |
| ![Very bad rating](/img/docs/usage/comments2.jpg) | Average rating is **very bad** (probably corrupt or a fake) |
| ![Poor rating](/img/docs/usage/comments3.jpg) | Average rating is **poor** (possible fake, corrupt, or very low quality) |
| ![Good rating](/img/docs/usage/comments4.jpg) | Average rating is **good** |
| ![Fair rating](/img/docs/usage/comments5.jpg) | Average rating is **fair** |
| ![Excellent rating](/img/docs/usage/comments6.jpg) | Average rating is **excellent** |

These icons also appear in search results when the server provides average rating data.

## Comments Window

The Comments window shows all comments and ratings that have been reported by other clients for a selected file. It is a useful tool for detecting fake or corrupt files.

### Reading Comments

The main list shows all received comments and ratings:

Each row contains:

| **File Name** | The name that client has given to the file |
| **Rating** | The rating the client assigned |
| **Comment** | The text comment the client provided |
