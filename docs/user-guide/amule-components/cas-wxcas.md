title: cas / wxcas — Statistics Tools
---

wxCAS and CAS are external statistics tools that read aMule's online signature file (`~/.aMule/amulesig.dat`) and produce status output in various formats. They are shipped with aMule and serve users who want to embed aMule statistics in a website, forum signature, or terminal dashboard.

| Binary | Interface | Output |
|---|---|---|
| `cas` | Command-line | Console text, PNG image, HTML page |
| `wxcas` | Graphical (wxWidgets) | Graphical display of the same data |

## Prerequisites

Both tools read `~/.aMule/amulesig.dat`, which aMule only generates when **Online Signature** is enabled:

1. Open aMule → **Preferences → Online Signature**.
2. Check **Enable Online Signature**.
3. Restart aMule (or wait for the next update cycle).

`amulesig.dat` is updated periodically while aMule runs. The file must exist for `cas` or `wxcas` to produce any output.

For the full format specification of `amulesig.dat`, see [amulesig.dat](../amule-files/amulesig-dat.md).

## CAS — C aMule Statistics

`cas` reads `amulesig.dat` and can produce:

- A formatted text summary on the console.
- A PNG image with statistics overlaid on a background template.
- An HTML page with all statistics.

### Console Output Example

Running `cas` with no arguments prints a status summary similar to:

```
aMule 2.3.3 has been running for 1 D 00 h
user is connected to server.example.com [81.84.97.64:4661] with HighID | Kad: ok
Total Download: 171.36 GB, Upload: 188.96 GB
Session Download: 475.42 MB, Upload: 832.46 MB
Download: 2.3 kB/s, Upload: 10.0 kB/s
Sharing: 98 file(s), Clients on queue: 237
Time: Jan 01 2024, 12:00
```

### Command-Line Options

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `-o`, `--picture` | Generate the statistics image (requires libgd at compile time) |
| `-p`, `--html` | Generate an HTML statistics page (and image if libgd is available) |
| `-c`, `--config-dir DIR` | Use `DIR` instead of the default aMule config directory |
| `-h`, `--help` | Show usage information |

Both `-o` and `-p` accept an optional path argument to override the default output location.

### Image Generation

When run with the `-o` flag, `cas` generates a PNG image ([`~/.aMule/aMule-online-sign.png`](../amule-files/cas.md)) by writing statistics text onto a configurable background image. This option is only available if `cas` was compiled with **libgd** support.

Configuration is stored in [`~/.aMule/casrc`](../amule-files/cas.md).

### [`casrc`](../amule-files/cas.md) Configuration File

`casrc` uses a key-value format. Example with all recognized options:

```
# cas config file

# font - full path to a TrueType font file
font /usr/share/fonts/corefonts/times.ttf

# font_size - font size in points
font_size 10.5

# source_image - background image to overlay text on
source_image /usr/share/cas/stat.png

# *_line - x,y,enabled (1=enabled, 0=disabled)
# Each line corresponds to one line of statistics text.
first_line   23,17,1
second_line  23,34,1
third_line   23,51,1
fourth_line  23,68,1
fifth_line   23,85,1
sixth_line   23,102,1
seventh_line 23,119,1

template /usr/share/cas/tmp.html

# img_type - 0 = PNG, any other value = JPG
img_type 0
```

**Default system paths** that `cas` uses when creating a new `casrc`:

| Resource | Default path |
|---|---|
| Font | `/usr/share/fonts/corefonts/times.ttf` |
| Background image | `/usr/share/cas/stat.png` |
| HTML template | `/usr/share/cas/tmp.html` |

### HTML Statistics Page

Run `cas` with the `-p`/`--html` flag to generate [`~/.aMule/aMule-online-sign.html`](../amule-files/cas.md), a full statistics page.

### Known Issues

- The uptime string in the console output is internationalized by aMule (it reflects aMule's configured language). There is no workaround at the time of writing.

## WxCAS — Graphical Statistics

`wxcas` provides a graphical window displaying the same statistics as `cas`. It is aimed at desktop users who want to monitor aMule status without a terminal.

Launch with:

```bash
wxcas
```

`wxcas` does not accept command-line arguments; all configuration is done through its Preferences dialog.

`wxcas` polls `amulesig.dat` periodically and refreshes the display automatically. The main window shows:

- **aMule panel**: the same seven status lines as `cas` (version/uptime, server connection, totals, session totals, current rates, shared files/queue, local time).
- **Download records panel**: peak download rate for the current session and the all-time record across all previous sessions.
- **System panel** (Linux only): system load averages (1, 5, 15 minutes) and system uptime.

### Image Generation

`wxcas` can generate a statistics image automatically at every refresh cycle. Supported formats: PNG, JPG, BMP. The output directory is configurable.

**Default output path:** `~/aMule-online-sign.{png,jpg,bmp}` (depending on the configured format). This is distinct from the `cas` default of `~/.aMule/aMule-online-sign.png`.

### FTP Upload

When auto image generation is enabled, `wxcas` can upload the image to an FTP server at a configurable interval. Configure the FTP URL, path, username and password from **Preferences**.

### Preferences

Key settings available in the Preferences dialog:

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| amulesig.dat directory | Directory where aMule writes `amulesig.dat` | `~/.aMule` |
| Refresh rate | How often to re-read `amulesig.dat`, in seconds (1–3600) | `5` |
| Generate stat image | Automatically save a statistics image on each refresh | disabled |
| Image format | PNG, JPG, or BMP | PNG |
| Image directory | Where to save the auto-generated image | `~/` |
| FTP upload | Periodically upload the image to an FTP server | disabled |
| FTP update rate | Upload interval in minutes (1–1440) | `10` |

## Troubleshooting

### `can't open file '/home/user/.aMule/amulesig.dat'`

aMule has not generated the signature file. Fix:

1. In aMule: **Preferences → Online Signature → Enable Online Signature**.
2. Ensure aMule is actually running and connected (the file is only written while aMule is active).
3. If the file still does not appear, check that `~/.aMule/` is writable.
