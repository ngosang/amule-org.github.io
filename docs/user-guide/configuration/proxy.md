title: Proxy

A proxy is an intermediate node in the network through which other nodes route their connections to reach a given destination. In most cases, it is a server that clients connect to in order to gain internet access: the proxy forwards requests to the internet and returns the responses to the client. In some cases it serves data from its cache or modifies packets in transit.

A proxy connection requires a specific protocol supported by both the proxy server and the connecting client. The most commonly used proxy protocols are **SOCKS4** and **SOCKS5**. SOCKS5 also supports username/password authentication.

## What aMule routes through the proxy

When a proxy is configured, aMule routes the following connections through it:

- Connections to eD2k servers
- Connections to other eD2k clients (downloads and uploads)
- Connections to the Kademlia network (where the proxy protocol supports UDP)

:::note
The option **Automatic server connect without proxy** exists in the Preferences dialog but is currently ignored by aMule.
