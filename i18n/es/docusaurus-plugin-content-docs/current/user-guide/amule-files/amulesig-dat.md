`amulesig.dat` is aMule's status signature file. It is written periodically by aMule to inform external applications — such as [CAS](./cas), [wxCAS](../amule-components/cas-wxcas), and IRC bots — of the current state of the running aMule instance.

**Location:** `~/.aMule/amulesig.dat`

`amulesig.dat` is the native aMule format and is a superset of eMule's `onlinesig.dat`. It carries considerably more information across 17 lines, while `onlinesig.dat` provides only 2 lines of basic status for compatibility with older eMule utilities.

## Format

The file is plain text. Each data field occupies exactly one line. The 17th (last) line **must** be followed by a newline character (`\n`). Line endings are always Unix (`\n`); never DOS (`\r\n`), even on Windows.

### Line reference

| Line | Field | Values | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | ED2K connection status | `0` = disconnected, `1` = connected, `2` = connecting | Value `2` introduced in aMule 2.0.0-rc4 |
| 2 | Server name | Server name string, or `0` | `0` when offline, connecting, or cleanly closed |
| 3 | Server IP | Server IP address string, or `0` | `0` when offline, connecting, or cleanly closed |
| 4 | Server port | Server port number, or `0` | `0` when offline, connecting, or cleanly closed |
| 5 | Client ID type | `H` (High ID), `L` (Low ID), or `0` | `0` when disconnected, connecting, or cleanly closed |
| 6 | Kademlia status | `0` = disconnected, `1` = connected (firewalled), `2` = connected (ok) | Introduced in aMule 2.1.0 |
| 7 | Download speed | Decimal number with exactly one decimal place (e.g., `157.2`) | `0.0` when cleanly closed (since rc4) |
| 8 | Upload speed | Decimal number with exactly one decimal place (e.g., `21.5`) | `0.0` when cleanly closed (since rc4) |
| 9 | Upload queue count | Integer — number of clients in the upload queue | `0` when cleanly closed |
| 10 | Shared file count | Integer — number of files currently shared | `0` when cleanly closed |
| 11 | Nickname | The user's configured nickname string | |
| 12 | Total bytes downloaded | Integer — cumulative bytes downloaded across all sessions | |
| 13 | Total bytes uploaded | Integer — cumulative bytes uploaded across all sessions | |
| 14 | aMule version | Version string, e.g. `2.3.3` or `CVS` | |
| 15 | Session bytes downloaded | Integer — bytes downloaded in the current session | `0` when connecting or cleanly closed (since rc4) |
| 16 | Session bytes uploaded | Integer — bytes uploaded in the current session | `0` when connecting or cleanly closed (since rc4) |
| 17 | Uptime | Seconds aMule has been running | `0` when cleanly closed (since rc6); see version notes below |

### Version history notes

- **aMule 2.0.0-rc4:** Introduced the `2` (connecting) status for line 1. Lines 2–5, 7, 8, 15, and 16 all report `0` / `0.0` when aMule is in connecting state or was cleanly closed.
- **aMule 2.0.0-rc5:** No format changes.
- **aMule 2.0.0-rc6:** Line 17 (uptime) changed from a human-readable string with unit (e.g., `3 mins`) to an integer number of seconds. When aMule is cleanly closed, line 17 is now `0` (previously it was `00 secs`).
- **aMule 2.1.0:** Line 6 (Kademlia status) was added. Files written by versions before 2.1.0 do not contain this line.
