# aMule Project Website

Source for the aMule project website at [https://amule-org.github.io](https://amule-org.github.io).

The site is built with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) and is internationalized (i18n).

## Requirements

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 24 or later and npm.

## Working locally

Install dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

Start the development server at `http://localhost:3000` with live reload (English):

```sh
npm run start
```

Build the complete site into `build/` and serve it at `http://localhost:3000`:

```sh
npm run build
npm run serve
```

> Use `npm run build` + `npm run serve` to preview the full production site with all languages and the local search index. `npm run start` (dev server) is faster for component development but does not include the search index.

## Contributing

The full contributor documentation lives on the site itself:

* [Documentation guide](https://amule-org.github.io/docs/developer/documentation) — repository structure, adding and editing pages, images, and the pull request workflow.
* [Translations guide](https://amule-org.github.io/docs/developer/translations) — translating the application interface, the man pages, and the documentation website.
* [Contributing](https://amule-org.github.io/docs/contributing) — all the ways to help the project.

## Translations

The website translations are managed with [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/amule/). See the [Documentation guide](https://amule-org.github.io/docs/developer/documentation#translating-with-weblate) for the component setup and contributor workflow.
